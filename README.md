# note-of-war
Note of war inspired by the actual tug of war game which two teams on opposite side of a rope pull against each other. In the game, players use loud voice as a rhythm to harmonize the team. Note of war mimics these tactics, but instead of using physical strength, but it receives voice instead, calculates the score and then adjust the position of each team.
